# Lender burning his position makes complete repayment of borrow position impossible
## Summary

A problem arises when a lender burns their Liquidity Provider (LP) position – it becomes impossible to fully close a loan.

## Vulnerability Detail

Current functionality is not prepared for a case where lender burns his position. He could do it intentionaly to harm the system, unaware that there is an open loan or he could be hacked. Hacker would harm both the user and the Wagmi protocol.

Within the [LiquidityBorrowingManager](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/contracts/LiquidityBorrowingManager.sol#L532) repay function, there are three situations for repaying a loan:

1. Borrower decides to close the loan.
2. The loan lacks collateral, leading to a liquidation event.
3. A lender triggers an emergency exit during a liquidation.

In the first two cases, the transactions fail because the position is no longer active, making it impossible to increase liquidity.

In the third case, things are a bit different. When a loan comprises positions from various lenders, all active positions can still be retrieved from the protocol. However, there's an issue – the bonus earned during liquidation becomes inaccessible, and the loan remains open.

### PoC 

#### 1. Borrower decides to close the loan.

[WagmiLeverageTests.ts#L448](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/test/WagmiLeverageTests.ts#L448)

```diff
it("repay borrowing and restore liquidity (long position WBTC zeroForSaleToken = false) will be successful", async () => {
    // ...
    params = {
        isEmergency: false,
        internalSwapPoolfee: 500,
        externalSwap: swapParams,
        borrowingKey: borrowingKey,
        swapSlippageBP1000: 990, //1%
    };
+   await nonfungiblePositionManager.connect(alice).burn(nftpos[3].tokenId);
    await borrowingManager.connect(bob).repay(params, deadline);
    // ...
});
```

> Result: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with reason string 'Invalid token ID'

#### 2. The loan lacks collateral, leading to a liquidation event.

[WagmiLeverageTests.ts#L1097](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/test/WagmiLeverageTests.ts#L1097)

```diff
it("Loan liquidation will be successful for anyone if the collateral is depleted", async () => {
    // ...
    let params: LiquidityBorrowingManager.RepayParamsStruct = {
        isEmergency: false,
        internalSwapPoolfee: 500,
        externalSwap: swapParams,
        borrowingKey: borrowingKey,
        swapSlippageBP1000: 990, //1%
    };

+   let loans: LiquidityManager.LoanInfoStructOutput[] = await borrowingManager.getLoansInfo(borrowingKey);
+   await nonfungiblePositionManager.connect(alice).burn(loans[0].tokenId);
    await borrowingManager.connect(alice).repay(params, deadline);
    // ...
});
```

> Result: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with reason string 'Invalid token ID'

#### 3. A lender triggers an emergency exit during a liquidation.

[WagmiLeverageTests.ts#L1023](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-real-wagmi/blob/main/wagmi-leverage/test/WagmiLeverageTests.ts#L1023)

```diff
it("emergency repay will be successful for PosManNFT owner if the collateral is depleted", async () => {
    // ...
    borrowingManager.getLoansInfo(borrowingKey);
    expect(loans.length).to.equal(3);
    //console.log(loans);
+   await nonfungiblePositionManager.connect(alice).burn(loans[0].tokenId);
    await expect(borrowingManager.connect(alice).repay(params, deadline))
        .to.emit(borrowingManager, "EmergencyLoanClosure")
        .withArgs(bob.address, alice.address, borrowingKey);
    // ...
});
```
> Result: Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: reverted with reason string 'ERC721: owner query for nonexistent token'

## Impact

The loan cannot be completely repaid. This will result in all borrowers using this burned position in their loan not wanting to borrow those tokens again because the loan will be opened endlessly and accumulate rates. Other lenders will have to initiate emergency withdraw and the liquidation bonus will be lost since it is distributed to the last lender who chooses to withdraw his funds in case of emergency withdraw.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add checks through the smart contracts to handle cases where the position is already burned.
